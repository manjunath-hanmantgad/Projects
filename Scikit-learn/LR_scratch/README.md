== Overall steps 

First, we download the dataset.

Next, we do some preliminary analysis of the data.

After that, we set up a validation strategy to make sure our model produces correct predictions.

Then we implement a linear regression model in Python and NumPy.

Next, we cover feature engineering to extract important features from the data to improve the model.

Finally, we see how to make our model stable with regularization and use it to predict car prices.
